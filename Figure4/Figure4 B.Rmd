## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
dt = data.frame(time = c(0,4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32,36,40,44,48,52),
                  OD600 = c(0.0479,0.0472,0.0504,0.0668,0.1084,0.2123,0.3812,0.6231,0.791,0.9484,
                            1.1135,1.1099,1.189,1.1402))
  dt$lg <- log10(dt$OD600)
  colnames(dt) <- c("time", "OD600","lg")
  
  par(mfrow=c(1,2))
  plot(type = "b", dt$time,dt$OD600, xlab = "Time(h)", ylab = "OD600")
  plot(type = "b", dt$time,dt$lg, pch=19, xlab = "Time(h)", ylab = "lg(OD600)" )
  par(mfrow=c(1,1))
  
  
  plot(type = "l", dt$time,dt$lg, pch=19, xlab = "Time(h)", ylab = "lg(OD600)" )
  abline(h = log10(c(0.1, 0.2, 0.4,0.8,1.0,1.2)), col = "pink")
  abline(v = seq(0,50,by=10), col = "grey")
  points(dt$time,dt$lg, pch=19)
  axis(4, log10(c(0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2)), as.character(c(0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2)), 
       col.ticks = "pink")
  t1 <- locator()
  t2 <- locator() 
  points(t1, pch=4, col = "red", cex = 1.5, lwd = 0.4)
  points(t2, pch=4, col = "red", cex = 1.5, lwd = 0.4)
  
  segments(t1$x, t1$y, t1$x, log10(0.1),"red")
  arrows(t1$x,log10(0.1),t2$x,log10(0.1), col = "red", length = 0.1,code =3)
  text(t1$x+(t2$x-t1$x)/2,log10(0.09), labels = paste0(round(t2$x-t1$x,2),"h"))
  segments(t2$x,log10(0.1),t2$x,t2$y,"red")
  
  dt.lm <- dt[5:7,]
  abline(lm(data = dt.lm, lg~time), col="blue", lty = "longdash")
  g <- round(log10(2)/coef(lm(data = dt.lm, lg~time))[2],2)
  mtext(text = paste0("calculated generation time is ",bquote(.(g)), "h."), adj=0)
                                         

## Including Plots

# You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
